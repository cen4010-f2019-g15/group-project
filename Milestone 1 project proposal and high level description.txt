Executive Summary
        Many students whether they live on campus or commute rely on the facilities provided on campus including dining locations, the library, recreational facilities, dormitories, parking areas, and classrooms. Additionally, campus administration must respond to the needs of students and ensure that these facilities adequately provide for the students and are properly maintained. When these services are not maintained well it can negatively impact students and leave them dissatisfied with the operation of the university.
        In order to provide for the needs of both students and administration we propose Campus Snapshots as a platform for providing up to date information regarding issues and events on campus. The purpose of this platform will be to keep university administration update on the current status of campus and problems affecting students. It will also provide a means for students to point out problems that they notice on campus and seek a resolution to them. Problems intended to be reported on the platform  include issues such as broken AC, clogged toilets, full trash bins, or other utilities on campus in disrepair. However, usage will not be limited to simply reporting issues. Students will also be able to post information about positive events and activities on campus such as informal student get togethers in order to foster a greater sense of community.
        The intention of Campus Snapshots is to improve the quality of service provided by the campus and allow for issues to be quickly and accurately identified. We also hope that this service will create a greater sense of community between students and administration by allowing them to cooperate on creating a better environment on campus. Students should be able to see real results when they report issues that they encounter by having them resolved in a timely manner and campus administration can be confident that they have an accurate view of the current state of the campus.

Although features such as creating posts and events would not be unique to Campus Snapshots, the simplicity (e.g. no extraneous features such as Direct Messaging) and much more student-specific functions (e.g. taking pictures of on-campus problems to report or creating an event page for other students) of Campus Snapshots will make it much more appealing to university students/faculty compared to generic social media applications like Facebook and Twitter.
________________
Data definition
Post - A user submission containing a location, short description and an image reporting an issue or informing about an event on campus. Posts have an associated state indicating if they have not been addressed, are in the process of being resolved, or have been resolved.
Comment - A text response to a post
Report Queue - A list of student, teacher, or faculty reports filterable by their current state from open to close or whether its flagged.
Administrative Queue - A list of posts flagged by users as containing content in violation of the rules of the platform.
Flagged - item deemed unfit for posting based on preset content administrative guidelines or relevance
Event Queue - A list of events filterable by their state ranging from planned, ongoing, cancelled, finished, or flagged. 
User - Any account that is created and subsequently used. A User is also either a Normal User or a Staff User.
Normal User - An account created by a university student, professor, or faculty.
Staff User - An account created by a Campus Snapshot staff member. Staff Users have administrative privileges (such as removing posts, suspension, and banning) over Normal Users.

Overview, scenarios and use cases
In order to use Campus Snapshots users will require access to and basic knowledge of a smartphone or computer. The interface will present the required information to make a post on the platform to users as well as content guidelines. Campus staff will require minimal training (at most 2 hours) on how to manage the posts on the website using the report and administrative queues as well as any staff regulations and content guidelines. Sample use cases are presented below.
1. A student notices the trash bin in a bathroom is full. They take a picture of the trash bin and post it to the website along with the location of the issues they are reporting and a brief description of the problem.
2. A campus staff member checks the report queue and sees a report regarding a water fountain not functioning properly. They inform the relevant maintenance personnel of the issues and mark the report as being worked on along with a comment. Later, upon receiving word that the water fountain has been fixed a staff member selects the associated report from the queue and marks it as done.
3. A user makes a post containing inappropriate content on the website. Another user notices the posts and reports it for violating the content guidelines. A campus staff member views the administration queue and confirms that the reported post should not be on the platform. The staff member notes down the information of the user who made the post to be forwarded to any relevant administrative personnel and deletes the post from public view.
4. A group of students are hosting a small event to attract new members to their student organization. They make a post with a picture of the event along with its location and a description of the event to the website to inform other students of its existence. Upon completion of the event, the student who made the posts marks it as complete or it is later automatically removed.
